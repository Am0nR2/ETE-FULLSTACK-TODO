FULLSTACK TODO APPLICATION

MADE WITH NESTJS, REACT AND TYPESCRIPT

I've included a postman collection inside the folder Postman,

TO RUN the APPLICATION:

Backend - NESTJS + TYPESCRIPT:

I've provided a dockerfile and a .env file inside the backend.

INSTALLIATION STEPS =>

    RUN COMMAND => cd backend

    RUN COMMAND => npm i

    RUN COMMAND => docker compose up

    RUN COMMAND => npm run start:dev

APPLICATION should start with no problems...

Frontend - REACT + TYPESCRIPT:

!!!!! IMPORTANT The REACT project created with command npm create@vite latest...

I've already checked if my code working, I uploaded it into netlify and it works perfectly fine... Here is the link :

NETLIFY:
=> https://653fa922912f0414274e3d1b--starlit-frangipane-4d92cf.netlify.app/

How to make it work without Netlify ?

INSTALLIATION STEPS =>

    RUN COMMAND => cd frontend

    RUN COMMAND => npm i

    RUN COMMAND => npm run dev

React app is also working perfectly fine
